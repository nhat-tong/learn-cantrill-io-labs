# Advanced Hybrid Directory Demo

In this Stage of the Demo lesson you will be creating a two-way forest TRUST between the Simulated On-Premises environment and AWS  
This will allow you to login to one, using ID's from the other  
It will allow you to grant access to the resources of one, from the other.  

# STAGE 4A - ONPREM Ensure That Kerberos Pre-authentication Is Enabled
