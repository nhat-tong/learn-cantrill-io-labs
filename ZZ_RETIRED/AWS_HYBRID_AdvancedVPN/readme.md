# Advanced Demo - Site-To-Site VPN

In this advanced demo you will get the chance to implement a Dynamic, BGP Based, Highly-Available Site-to-Site VPN
The demo simulates a Hybrid AWS and On-premises environment - both using AWS.  

The demo consists of 5 stages, each implementing additional components of the architecture

- Stage 1 - Provision the environments
- Stage 2 - TGW VPN Attachments
- Stage 3 - IPSec Tunnel Configuration
- Stage 4 - BGP Routing and Testing
- Stage 5 - Cleanup

## 1-Click Installs
Make sure you are logged into AWS and in `us-east-1`  
Apply the first template and THEN once the first is in `CREATE_COMPLETE` the second
